    def __init__(self, num_models, hidden_dim):
        self.attention_weights = MultiHeadAttention(num_models, hidden_dim)
        self.fusion_network = TransformerEncoder()
        self.uncertainty_estimator = MCDropoutEnsemble()

    def forward(self, model_outputs, uncertainty_context):
        attention_scores = self.attention_weights(model_outputs)
        fused_output = self.fusion_network(attention_scores * model_outputs)
        confidence_scores = self.uncertainty_estimator.estimate_confidence(fused_output)
        return fused_output, confidence_scores
```
