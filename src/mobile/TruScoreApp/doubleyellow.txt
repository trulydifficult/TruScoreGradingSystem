Solutions to Resolve Yellow Underlines:
Wrap with Material or Scaffold.
The most common and straightforward solution is to ensure your Text widget, or its parent, is wrapped within a Material or Scaffold widget. Scaffold is typically used for entire pages and inherently includes a Material widget.
Code

    Material(
      child: Text('Your Text Here'),
    )
or
Code

    Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Your Text Here'),
      ),
    )
Define DefaultTextStyle in MaterialApp.
For a more global solution, particularly if you are building an app without a conventional Material Design structure, you can explicitly set a DefaultTextStyle in your MaterialApp's builder property.
Code

    MaterialApp(
      builder: (context, child) {
        return DefaultTextStyle(
          style: DefaultTextStyle.of(context).style.copyWith(
                decoration: TextDecoration.none, // Removes the underline
              ),
          child: child!,
        );
      },
      home: MyHomePage(),
    )
Customize TextStyle (for specific cases).
If the yellow line is desired for a specific Text widget but you want to control its appearance, you can directly modify the decoration property within the TextStyle of that Text widget.
Code

    Text(
      'Your Text Here',
      style: TextStyle(
        decoration: TextDecoration.none, // Removes the underline
      ),
    )
By implementing one of these solutions, you can effectively remove the double yellow lines under text widgets in your Flutter application, ensuring a cleaner and more professional visual presentation.
