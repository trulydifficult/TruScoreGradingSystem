## Safety — Never Run Destructive Commands

> Dangerous commands are actively monitored.
> Critical/high risk commands trigger error notifications in real-time.

- **NEVER** run `rm -rf`, `del /s`, `rmdir`, `format`, or any command that deletes files/directories without EXPLICIT user approval.
- **NEVER** run `DROP TABLE`, `DELETE FROM`, `TRUNCATE`, or any destructive database operation.
- **NEVER** run `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, or any command that rewrites history.
- **NEVER** run `npm publish`, `docker rm`, `terraform destroy`, or any irreversible deployment/infrastructure command.
- **NEVER** pipe remote scripts to shell (`curl | bash`, `wget | sh`).
- **ALWAYS** ask the user before running commands that modify system state, install packages, or make network requests.
- When in doubt, **show the command first** and wait for approval.

## Project Standards

- Extract repeated class patterns into components
- Use responsive prefixes consistently (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- Don't use arbitrary values when a utility class exists
- Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size
- Use BackgroundTasks for non-blocking operations
- Use async def for I/O-bound endpoints
- Use dependency injection for shared logic

## Learned Patterns

- Avoid: Dispose controllers in StatefulWidget.dispose() (seen 2x)
- Agent generates new migration for every change (squash related changes)
- Agent installs packages without checking if already installed

### 📚 Core Framework Rules: [anthropics/algorithmic-art]
Algorithmic philosophies are computational aesthetic movements that are then expressed through code. Output .md files (philosophy), .html files (interactive viewer), and .js files (generative algorithms).

This happens in two steps:
1. Algorithmic Philosophy Creation (.md file)
2. Express by creating p5.js generative art (.html + .js files)

First, undertake this task:

## ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY CREATION

To begin, create an ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY (not static images or templates) that will be interpreted through:
- Computational processes, emergent behavior, mathematical beauty
- Seeded randomness, noise fields, organic systems
- Particles, flows, fields, forces
- Parametric variation and controlled chaos

### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING
- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user to take into account, but use as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.
- What is created: An algorithmic philosophy/generative aesthetic movement.
- What happens next: The same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT IN CODE - creating p5.js sketches that are 90% algorithmic generation, 10% essential parameters.

Consider this approach:
- Write a manifesto for a generative art movement
- The next phase involves writing the algorithm that brings it to life

The philosophy must emphasize: Algorithmic expression. Emergent behavior. Computational beauty. Seeded variation.

### HOW TO GENERATE AN ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY

**Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Organic Turbulence" / "Quantum Harmonics" / "Emergent Stillness"

**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):

To capture the ALGORITHMIC essence, express how this philosophy manifests through:
- Computational processes and mathematical relationships?
- Noise functions and randomness patterns?
- Particle behaviors and field dynamics?
- Temporal evolution and system states?
- Parametric variation and emergent complexity?

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**
- **Avoid redundancy**: Each algorithmic aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating concepts about noise theory, particle dynamics, or mathematical principles unless adding new depth.
- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final algorithm should appear as though it took countless hours to develop, was refined with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like "meticulously crafted algorithm," "...

## Authentication & Configuration

Prefer environment variables over hard-coding parameters when creating the client. Initialize the client without parameters to automatically pick up these values.

### Application Default Credentials (ADC)
Set these variables for standard [Google Cloud authentication](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/gcp-auth):

- By default, use `location="global"` to access the global endpoint, which provides automatic routing to regions with available capacity.
- If a user explicitly asks to use a specific region (e.g., `us-central1`, `europe-west4`), speci...

## API spec (source of truth)

**Always use the latest REST API discovery spec as the source of truth for API definitions** (request/response schemas, parameters, methods). Fetch the spec when implementing or debugging API integration:

- **v1beta** (default): `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1beta`  
  Use this unless the integration is explicitly pinned to v1. The official SDKs (google-genai, @google/genai, google.golang.org/genai) target v1beta.
- **v1**: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1`  
  Use only when the integration is specifically set to v1.

When in doubt, use v1beta. Refer to the spec for exac...

# React Native Best Practices

## Overview

Performance optimization guide for React Native applications, covering JavaScript/React, Native (iOS/Android), and bundling optimizations. Based on Callstack's "Ultimate Guide to React Native Optimization".

## Skill Format

Each reference file follows a hybrid format for fast lookup and deep understanding:

- **Quick Pattern**: Incorrect/Correct code snippets for immediate pattern matching
- **Quick Command**: Shell commands for process/measurement skills
- **Quick Config**: Configuration snippets for setup-focused skills
- **Quick Reference**: Summary tables for conceptual skills
- **Deep Dive**: Full context with When to Use, Prerequisites, Step-by-Step, Common Pitfalls

**Impact ratings**: CRITICAL (fix immediately), HIGH (significant improvement), MEDIUM (worthwhile optimization)

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Debugging slow/janky UI or animations
- Investigating memory leaks (JS or native)
- Optimizing app startup time (TTI)
- Reducing bundle or app size
- Writing native modules (Turbo Modules)
- Profiling React Native performance
- Reviewing React Native code for performance

## Security Notes

- Treat shell commands in these references as local developer operations. Review them before running, prefer version-pinned tooling, and avoid piping remote scripts directly to a shell.
- Treat third-party libraries and plugins as dependencies that still require normal supply-chain controls: pin versions, verify provenance, and update through your standard review process.
- Treat Re.Pack code splitting as first-party artifact delivery only. Remote chunks must come from trusted HTTPS origins you control and be pinned to the current app release.

## Priority-Ordered Guidelines

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | FPS & Re-renders | CRITICAL | `js-*` |
| 2 | Bundle Size | CRITICAL | `bundle-*` |
| 3 | TTI Optimization | HIGH | `native-*`, `bundle-*` |
| 4 | Native Performance | HIGH | `native-*` |
| 5 | Memory Management | MEDIUM-HIGH | `js-*`, `native-*` |
| 6 | Animations | MEDIUM | `js-*` |

## Quick Reference

### Optimization Workflow

Follow this cycle for any performance issue: **Measure → Optimize → Re-measure → Validate**

1. **Measure**: Capture baseline metrics (FPS, TTI, bundle size) before changes
2. **Optimize**: Apply the targeted fix from the relevant reference
3. **Re-measure**: Run the same measurement to get updated metrics
